    <h1>Climate change's affects on Puerto Rico</h1>
    <p>Quoted from climaterealityproject.org "“We need to stop talking about climate change in future tense. It’s already here.” –Carlos Ramos-Scharrón, ecologist and Puerto Rico native.

      Rising sea levels, stronger and more frequent hurricanes, and increased flooding are just some of the ways in which the climate crisis is impacting the lives of Puerto Ricans. As Hurricanes Maria and Fiona and the massive power grid failure underscore, the Island of Enchantment has become one of the most climate-impacted places in the world."</p>
